        A web application is an interactive program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser. A
        web app is built so that the user interface provides data back to the development team that designed it. This
        data offers insights into customer interests, usage, and preferences that can prove invaluable to product and
        marketing strategies. The data can also inform optimization and other client-centered aspects of the mobile app
        or desktop applications.

        <h2>Graphics Design</h2>
        <p>Graphic design is the profession and academic discipline whose activity consists in projecting visual
          communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives. Design is
          based on the principle of "form follows a specific function".

          Therefore, graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design whose foundations and objectives revolve
          around the definition of problems and the determination of objectives for decision-making, through creativity,
          innovation and lateral thinking along with manual or digital tools, transforming them for proper
          interpretation. This activity helps in the optimization of graphic communications (see also communication
          design). It is also known as visual communication design, visual design or editorial design.</p>

          Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
          (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
          complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of
          tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
          development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration,
          and e-commerce development.

        <h2> App Devlopment</h2>
        <p> Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as
          personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These software applications are
          designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be
          pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or
          client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a web browser.
          Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and
          configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms.
          Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report
          estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60
          percent of which are mobile app developers.
